Run `./program_prompt.sh` to test any of the programs. Some might not be able to run depending on the OS being used.

### Building
For BASIC, use FreeBASIC with the `fbc -lang qb` option.

For Scheme, have Racket installed. No compilation is necessary.

For C, have `gcc` installed and compile with `gcc -o $prog_name $prog_name.c`

For Java, any version of `javac` should work. Use `javac $prog_name.java`.

For Go, any version of Go should work. No need to compile the programs.
